title: Payload
description: The payload object that is sent from the server-side to all the applicable clients holds all the important data users need so they can know which custom events they will use for whatever custom events they may receive.

## Sending data through the payload object

When a client invokes a method, data is sent as the value of the payload property in a packet.
The payload is designed to be versatile so it may contain a message, a channel to change to, and more.

### 
```ts lineNumbers=true
/* In this example, it is assumed that a different client has sent a message.
The recipient below is listening for a message and has access to the payload of a packet.
The recipient will then be able to display the data from the payload.
*/

sono.on('message', (payload) => {
 const message = document.createElement('li');
 message.innerText = payload.message;
 messageBoard.appendChild(message);
});

```
