## Creating a new channel

The sono.channel is used to create and add a custom channel to the servers Channels list. Creating a channel will allow clients to create specific channels, allowing users to see and send messages only to those that are in the current channel. The channel method takes in a string as an argument which will be the desired name of the channel, and optionally a callback.



### Server Side
```ts lineNumbers=true
const server = serve({ port: 8080 });
const sono = new TestSono();

// An example of using channel once an instance of Sono is made
sono.channel('newChannel', () => {
  console.log('new channel created')
})

```
