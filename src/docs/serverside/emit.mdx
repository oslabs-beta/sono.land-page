## When should you be using sono.emit and what does it do?

When you need to send a message to all clients that are currently connected to the server, emit method is used to execute that task. It takes in one argument, a message, to send to all clients that are currently connected via websocket through the channels list.


### Client Side
```ts lineNumbers=true 

// Listening for requests coming into server
for await (const req of server) {
  // Serving an html file when client first connects to server
  if (req.method === "GET" && req.url === "/") {
    const path = `${Deno.cwd()}/index.html`
    const content = await serveFile(req, path);
    req.respond(content)
  }
  /* An example of how we can use emit once the client side sends the 
  initiation of a WebSocket handshake and the process is complete */
  else if (req.method === "GET" && req.url === "/ws") {
    sono.connect(req, ()=> {
      sono.emit('new client connected')
    });
  }

```
