# Welcome to sono.land!

__sono__ is a lightweight module for Deno🦖 that enables real-time bidirectional communication between clients by using native WebSocket and WebRTC APIs. 
Our module abstracts away the low-level implementation of [ws](https://deno.land/std@0.95.0/ws) from the Deno Standard Library.
By importing our module, developers can build their own telecommunications app that lets users communicate with low latency and high reliability.
