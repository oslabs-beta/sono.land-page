# Introduction

Sono.io is a lightweight module for Deno🦖 that enables real-time bidirectional communication between clients by using native WebSocket and WebRTC APIs. 
Sono.io abstracts away the low-level implementation of [ws](https://deno.land/std@0.95.0/ws) from the Deno Standard Library and allows developers to build applications on the Deno runtime that lets users communicate with low latency and high reliability.
Sono.io consists of a server-side module and client-side module that can be used together to achieve

This communication suite abstracts the low level server implementation from the Deno Standard Library to aid in agile developemnt.
We've constructed a way for users to interact with each other in just a few lines of code.
